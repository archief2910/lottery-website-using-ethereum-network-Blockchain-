This project involves a decentralized lottery application built on the Ethereum blockchain. The application allows players to participate by sending their Ether (cryptocurrency) to a smart contract. The contract utilizes the SHA3 algorithm to generate a random winner among the registered players. The contract is deployed and tested on the Sepolia test network using Ganache, a local blockchain emulator, and Mocha, a testing framework for Ethereum projects.
The smart contract is written in Solidity version 0.4.17 and includes two main functions:
1. Entering the Lottery: Players can participate in the lottery by sending their Ether to the smart contract. This action registers them as participants and adds their Ether to the contract's balance.
2. Getting the Addresses of Participants: The contract includes a function that allows anyone to retrieve the addresses of the players who have registered for the current lottery round.
